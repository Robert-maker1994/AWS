Amazon EC2 

E2C is one of the most popular. 
• EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS’ offering • EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service • It mainly consists in the capability of : • Renting virtual machines (EC2) • Storing data on virtual drives (EBS) • Distributing load across machines (ELB) • Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
• Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works

EC2 sizing && configuration 

Operating Systems (OS): linux windows or mac
How much CPU, RAM and storage space (network-attached and hardware) 

EC2 User Data
You can bootstrap our instances using an EC2 user data. 

Hands-On: Launching an EC2 Instance running Linux
 • We’ll be launching our first virtual server using the AWS Console • We’ll get a first high-level approach to the various parameters • We’ll see that our web server is launched using EC2 user data • We’ll learn how to start / stop / terminate our instance

You can start an instance in the free tear of AWS. Pick all the default settings and then start and STOP WHEN NOT USING.

EC3 Instances Types 

General-purpose 

m5.2xlarge.  What does this mean?

m: instance class 
5: generation (AWS improves overtime)
2xlarge: size within the instance class  (RAM & CPU)



EC2 Instance Types - Compute Optimized 
Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories • Balance between: • Compute • Memory • Networking • In the course, we will be using the t2.micro which is a General Purpose EC2 instance

EC2 Instance Types – Compute Optimized 
• Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors: • Batch processing workloads • Media transcoding • High performance web servers • High performance computing (HPC) • Scientific modeling & machine learning • Dedicated gaming servers

EC2 Instance Types - Memory Optimized
• Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory • Use cases: • High performance, relational/non-relational databases • Distributed web scale cache stores • In-memory databases optimized for BI (business intelligence) • Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data

EC2 Instance Types - Storage Optimized

 Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage • Use cases: • High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems • Relational & NoSQL databases • Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis) • Data warehousing applications • Distributed file systems 



Introduction to Security Groups

Are the undamental of network security in AWS.

Deeper Dive 
Security groups are acting as a "firewall" on EC" instances.
They Regulate:
Access to ports 
Authorised IP ranges - IPv4 and IPv6 
Control of inbound network from other to the instance
control outbound network from the instance to the other
Source 0.0.0.0/0 means everywhere.

GOOD TO KNOW
Can be attached to multiple instances 
Locked down to a region /VPC combination
Does live "outside " the EC2 - if traffic is blocked the Ec2 instance won't see it.

Clasics ports to know 

22 = SSH 
21 = FTP 
22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
80 = HTTP - access unsecured websites
443 = HTTPS - access secured website 
3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocal) 
TCP = ()

EC2 Instance Connect • Connect to your EC2 instance within your browser • No need to use your key file that was downloaded • The “magic” is that a temporary key is uploaded onto EC2 by AWS • Works only out-of-the-box with Amazon Linux 2 • Need to make sure the port 22 is still opened!

When you connect to your amazon instances never ever configure your IAM user credentials. Instead, you have to use IAM Roles. Give the Instance a role. IAMacessRoles. This is an example of our responsibility in AWS. 

EC2 Instances Purchasing Options
 • On-Demand Instances: short workload, predictable pricing • Reserved: (MINIMUM 1 year) • Reserved Instances: long workloads • Convertible Reserved Instances: long workloads with flexible instances • Scheduled Reserved Instances: example – every Thursday between 3 and 6 pm • Spot Instances: short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable) • Dedicated Hosts: book an entire physical server, control instance placement • Dedicated Instances: no other customers will share your hardware

EC2 Reserved Instances 
• Up to 72% discount compared to On-demand • Reservation period: 1 year = + discount | 3 years = +++ discount • Purchasing options: no upfront | partial upfront = + | All upfront = ++ discount • Reserve a specific instance type • Recommended for steady-state usage applications (think database) • Convertible Reserved Instance • can change the EC2 instance type • Up to 45% discount • Scheduled Reserved Instances • launch within time window you reserve • When you require a fraction of day / week / month • Commitment for 1 year only 

EC2 Spot Instances 
• Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand • Instances that you can “lose” at any point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price • The MOST cost-efficient instances in AWS • Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure • Batch jobs • Data analysis • Image processing • Any distributed workloads • Workloads with a flexible start and end time •
 Not suitable for critical jobs or databases

EC2 On-Demand 



Shared Responsibility Model for ec2 

• Infrastructure (global network security) • Isolation on physical hosts • Replacing faulty hardware • Compliance validation 

• Security Groups rules • Operating-system patches and updates • Software and utilities installed on the EC2 instance • IAM Roles assigned to EC2 & IAM user access management • Data security on your instance

EC2 Section – Summary 
• EC2 Instance: AMI (OS) + Instance Size (CPU + RAM) + Storage + security groups + EC2 User Data • Security Groups: Firewall attached to the EC2 instance • EC2 User Data: Script launched at the first start of an instance • SSH: start a terminal into our EC2 Instances (port 22) • EC2 Instance Role: link to IAM roles • Purchasing Options: On-Demand, Spot, Reserved (Standard + Convertible + Scheduled), Dedicated Host, Dedicated Instance

Q: Which network security tool can you use to control traffic in and out of EC2 Instances? :A  Security Groups 

:Q: A company would like to deploy a high-performance computing (HPC) application on EC2. Which EC2 instance type should it choose? A : Compute Optimized 
Compute Optimized EC2 instances are great for compute-intensive workloads requiring high-performance processors, such as batch processing, media transcoding, high-performance web servers, high performance computing, scientific modeling & machine learning, and dedicated gaming servers.
